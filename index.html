<p>An education in German helps students achieve their learning goals, whether they want to engage in business with German partners, work in government or in the media, or participate in German culture. Our students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while acquiring a rich understanding of the literature, cinema, history and culture of the German-speaking world.</p>

<p>German Program Overview</p>

German is a major world language spoken in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and in sections of other countries (e.g. Alsace) as well as in communities throughout the world. Whether you are interested in economics, history, literature, music, theater, film, or art, German culture has a rich and exciting tradition. Temple’s German program provides broad linguistic, cultural, and practical experiences to prepare students to participate meaningfully in the German-speaking world, be it in graduate school, the professions, or business. In the course of their studies, students develop skills in reading, writing, and oral communication as they engage with the German language through literature, media and arts. Advanced classes explore culture and history as they shape German identities, providing students with an understanding of current German-speaking cultures through the analytical lenses of language, literature, cinema and history. Majors complete the program with an in-depth understanding of the history, cinema, art and culture of German-speaking people in a globalized world, and with an awareness of how language shapes peoples’ cultures.

## Curriculum

The German program at Temple University offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that provides students with knowledge of the German language and that places a strong emphasis on Cultural Studies. The curriculum emphasizes the interconnectedness of literature, culture and politics as they shape German national identities in the past and present. Once students have acquired basic knowledge of the German language in introductory and intermediate language classes, upper level language and culture courses offer German majors a broad knowledge of canonical writers and historical events as well as in-depth studies of social and historical phenomena like nationalism (in particular the development of German fascism), gender relations, and contemporary debates on multiculturalism. Intermediate and advanced language classes combine language acquisition with cultural and historical studies as students explore the diverse cultures of German-speaking regions. Classes on German cinema and special topic seminars investigating specific historical periods (such as during the Weimar Republic) or particular themes (such as immigration) all explore culture and history as they shape German identities, providing students with an understanding of current German-speaking cultures through the analytical lenses of language, literature, cinema and history.
