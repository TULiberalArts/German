## German Program Overview
![Geramn Students]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Waskie and students.jpg){:.img-right}
German is a major world language spoken in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and in sections of other countries (e.g. Alsace) as well as in communities throughout the world. Whether you are interested in economics, history, literature, music, theater, film, or art, German culture has a rich and exciting tradition. Temple’s German program provides broad linguistic, cultural, and practical experiences to prepare students to participate meaningfully in the German-speaking world, be it in graduate school, the professions, or business.

In the course of their studies, students develop skills in reading, writing, and oral communication as they engage with the German language through literature, media and arts. Advanced classes explore culture and history as they shape German identities, providing students with an understanding of current German-speaking cultures through the analytical lenses of language, literature, cinema and history. Majors complete the program with an in-depth understanding of the history, cinema, art and culture of German-speaking people in a globalized world, and with an awareness of how language shapes peoples’ cultures.

## A Caring Learning Community
Students of German at Temple University are part of a  vibrant, dynamic and successful community within the  greater university setting. A Temple German student has  one-on-one access to faculty, as well as other students interested in German language and culture. This interest can be explored in our Temple University German Society (TUGS) and contacts with the German ethnic community of the  Philadelphia region. Some examples are: the German Society of Pennsylvania, German-American Chamber of Commerce, Cannstatter V.V. and the Philadelphia German-American Committee.

We offer a foreign language certificate in German that provides students with a foundation in the German language. It also introduces courses such as conversation, reading and composition. Students strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret the language and culture.

## Outstanding Faculty
Smaller class size and innovative teaching techniques and use of technology allow faculty and students to build a close rapport that creates a favorable learning environment that enhances learning. Students are encouraged to interact with faculty, peers, and visiting students from German-speaking countries and volunteer tutoring leads to success in  acquiring greater proficiency. The faculty strives to help students develop their full potential and talent in German. Opportunities to study and work abroad and find a career path that utilizes students’ language skills will be developed and realized.

## Internships
We encourage students to apply to participate in an internship in a German-speaking country. There are several types of internships German majors have successfully applied to in the past. Fulbright Teaching Assistantships: In the past 12 years, more than ten students in the German Program have successfully completed a one-year assistantship in teaching English as a foreign language in a German-speaking country.

German-American Chamber of Commerce: Several students have participated in paid summer internships in Germany through the German-American Chamber of Commerce, examples include Marta Sydoyak (2013) and Christopher Fry (2014).
