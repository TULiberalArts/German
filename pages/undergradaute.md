German is one of the great world languages and leading Western cultures. The German-speaking national block is a leading economic power in the world community and is a leader in job creation, technology, innovation and creativity in the global arena. An education in German helps students achieve their learning goals, whether you want to engage in business with German partners, work in government or in the media, or participate in German culture. Our students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while acquiring a rich understanding of the literature, cinema, history and culture of the German-speaking world.

We offer a foreign language certificate in German that provides students with a foundation in the German language. It also introduces courses such as conversation, reading and composition. Students strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret the language and culture.

## Outstanding Faculty

Smaller class size and innovative teaching techniques and use of technology allow faculty and students to build a close rapport that creates a favorable learning environment that enhances learning. Students are encouraged to interact with faculty, peers, and visiting students from German-speaking countries and volunteer tutoring leads to success in  acquiring greater proficiency. The faculty strives to help students develop their full potential and talent in German. Opportunities to study and work abroad and find a career path that utilizes students’ language skills will be developed and realized.

Our German faculty includes many Ph.D. graduates with extensive backgrounds in study and living abroad in German-Speaking countries, and with years of teaching experience.

## A Caring Learning Community

Students of German at Temple University are part of a  vibrant, dynamic and successful community within the  greater university setting. A Temple German student has  one-on-one access to faculty, as well as other students interested in German language and culture. This interest can be explored in our Temple University German Society (TUGS) and contacts with the German ethnic community of the  Philadelphia region. Some examples are: the German Society of Pennsylvania; German-American Chamber of Commerce; Cannstatter V.V. and the Philadelphia German-American Committee.

## German Program Overview

German is a major world language spoken in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and in sections of other countries (e.g. Alsace) as well as in communities throughout the world. Whether you are interested in economics, history, literature, music, theater, film, or art, German culture has a rich and exciting tradition. Temple’s German program provides broad linguistic, cultural, and practical experiences to prepare students to participate meaningfully in the German-speaking world, be it in graduate school, the professions, or business. In the course of their studies, students develop skills in reading, writing, and oral communication as they engage with the German language through literature, media and arts. Advanced classes explore culture and history as they shape German identities, providing students with an understanding of current German-speaking cultures through the analytical lenses of language, literature, cinema and history. Majors complete the program with an in-depth understanding of the history, cinema, art and culture of German-speaking people in a globalized world, and with an awareness of how language shapes peoples’ cultures.

## Programs of Study

The German Program at Temple offers a B.A. in German, as well as a minor and a certificate in the German language. To be considered for Distinction in the German Major, students must complete the requirements for the concentration in German with a GPA of at least 3.50; have an overall GPA of at least 3.25; and be recommended to the Chair of the department by the German faculty advisor.

## Curriculum

The German program at Temple University offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that provides students with knowledge of the German language and that places a strong emphasis on Cultural Studies. The curriculum emphasizes the interconnectedness of literature, culture and politics as they shape German national identities in the past and present. Once students have acquired basic knowledge of the German language in introductory and intermediate language classes, upper level language and culture courses offer German majors a broad knowledge of canonical writers and historical events as well as in-depth studies of social and historical phenomena like nationalism (in particular the development of German fascism), gender relations, and contemporary debates on multiculturalism. Intermediate and advanced language classes combine language acquisition with cultural and historical studies as students explore the diverse cultures of German-speaking regions. Classes on German cinema and special topic seminars investigating specific historical periods (such as during the Weimar Republic) or particular themes (such as immigration) all explore culture and history as they shape German identities, providing students with an understanding of current German-speaking cultures through the analytical lenses of language, literature, cinema and history.

## Internships

We encourage students to apply to participate in an internship in a German-speaking country. There are several types of internships German majors have successfully applied to in the past. Fulbright Teaching Assistantships: In the past 12 years, more than ten students in the German Program have successfully completed a one-year assistantship in teaching English as a foreign language in a German-speaking country.
German-American Chamber of Commerce: Several students have participated in paid summer internships in Germany through the German-American Chamber of Commerce, examples include Marta Sydoyak (2013) and Christopher Fry (2014).

TUGS meets on Wednesdays at 4:00pm in 506 Anderson Hall. All are welcome to attend and participate!

Members of the German Society meet together in activities outside the classroom. Events include movie nights, visits to traditional German restaurants, hosting German students, speakers, parades and a variety of other German culture focused programs. Our members also offer peer tutoring, conversation practice and study help to further learning and interest in the German language. This helps students be better prepared for the classroom.
