German is one of the great world languages and leading Western cultures. The German-speaking national block is a leading economic power in the world community and is a leader in job creation, technology, innovation and creativity in the global arena. An education in German helps students achieve their learning goals, whether you want to engage in business with German partners, work in government or in the media, or participate in German culture. Our students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while acquiring a rich understanding of the literature, cinema, history and culture of the German-speaking world.

We offer a foreign language certificate in German that provides students with a foundation in the German language. It also introduces courses such as conversation, reading and composition. Students strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret the language and culture.

## Outstanding Faculty

Smaller class size and innovative teaching techniques and use of technology allow faculty and students to build a close rapport that creates a favorable learning environment that enhances learning. Students are encouraged to interact with faculty, peers, and visiting students from German-speaking countries and volunteer tutoring leads to success in  acquiring greater proficiency. The faculty strives to help students develop their full potential and talent in German. Opportunities to study and work abroad and find a career path that utilizes studentsâ€™ language skills will be developed and realized.

Our German faculty includes many Ph.D. graduates with extensive backgrounds in study and living abroad in German-Speaking countries, and with years of teaching experience.

## A Caring Learning Community

Students of German at Temple University are part of a  vibrant, dynamic and successful community within the  greater university setting. A Temple German student has  one-on-one access to faculty, as well as other students interested in German language and culture. This interest can be explored in our Temple University German Society (TUGS) and contacts with the German ethnic community of the  Philadelphia region. Some examples are: the German Society of Pennsylvania; German-American Chamber of Commerce; Cannstatter V.V. and the Philadelphia German-American Committee.
