## Temple University German Society (TUGS)
TUGS meets on Wednesdays at 4:00pm in 506 Anderson Hall. All are welcome to attend and participate!

Members of the German Society meet together in activities outside the classroom. Events include movie nights, visits to traditional German restaurants, hosting German students, speakers, parades and a variety of other German culture focused programs. Our members also offer peer tutoring, conversation practice and study help to further learning and interest in the German language. This helps students be better prepared for the classroom. The only requirement for membership is a desire to expand one’s knowledge about the German culture and language in a social atmosphere. If you are interested and would like more information, visit us online or email us so that we may update you on upcoming German Society events.

- President: Mikayla Appell
- Treasurer: Lauren Weller
- Secretary: Samuel Cook
- Events Coordinator: Gabe Neely
- Faculty Advisor: Dr. Anthony Waskie

## German DELTA PHI ALPHA
Delta Phi Alpha National German Honor Society, Gamma Omicron Chapter

Established in 1949, the National German Honor Society, Delta Phi Alpha, seeks to recognize excellence in the study of German and to provide an incentive for higher scholarship. The Society aims to promote the study of the German language, literature and civilization and endeavors to emphasize those aspects of German life and culture which are of universal value and which contribute to man’s eternal search for peace and truth.

Congratulations to Christiana Jackson (CLA ’11) for receiving a prestigious Fulbright Assistantship to teach in a German School. Christina has now completed her Assistantship successfully. Needless to state, we are very proud of all of our stellar products of the German Department at Temple University! Christiana is a previous recipient of the Delta Phi Alpha National German Honor Society induction; she has been active in our Temple German Society. Well Done!
