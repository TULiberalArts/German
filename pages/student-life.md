![Study Abroad]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Leipzig.jpg){:.img-right}
Students declaring a major or minor in the department are strongly encouraged to study abroad. Options include semester or year long exchange programs at the universities of Hamburg and Tübingen as well as the summer intensive German program in Leipzig. Courses completed in these programs may be credited toward the German major or minor and in partial satisfaction of the International Studies requirement.

### About Leipzig
Located in the heart of Europe in former East Germany, the city of Leipzig has a population of over 600,000. In the past, Leipzig was a center of trade fairs, the seat of the German Supreme Court, the leading center of libraries, publishing houses and the German book trade, and the hub of European trade. One thing which remains unchanged is Leipzig’s significance as a city of music, the arts, and above all science and learning. Founded in 1409, its university is the second oldest in Germany. Leipzig’s historic importance is self-evident from its numerous magnificent buildings, now mostly refurbished, which include first-class sights such as the Old Town Hall, the Old Exchange, the old and new exhibition centers, and the Monument to the Battle of Leipzig. Located in a beautiful area of vistas, history, and culture, Leipzig is only two hours from Berlin; one hour from Dresden and Weimar, and three hours from Prague.

### Courses
During the first week of the program students will participate in an orientation that will familiarize them with the university and the city. The orientation will also include an excursion to Dresden. The following three weeks will consist of intensive language study and excursions outside of the city. Students will take placement tests upon arrival and will then enroll in the appropriate level of German. Beginning students, who must have at least one semester of German or its equivalent, will enroll in German 1002 for four credits. Intermediate students will enroll in German 1003 or German 2001 for three credits, plus a one-credit Independent Study in German Studies. Students placing at advanced levels may enroll in other advanced German courses: Advanced Composition, or Intensive German, plus a one-credit Independent Study in German Studies.

TUGS meets on Wednesdays at 4:00pm in 506 Anderson Hall. All are welcome to attend and participate!

Members of the German Society meet together in activities outside the classroom.

Our members also offer peer tutoring, conversation practice and study help to further learning and interest in the German language. This helps students be better prepared for the classroom. The only requirement for membership is a desire to expand one’s knowledge about the German culture and language in a social atmosphere.
