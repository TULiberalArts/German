## A Leading Economic Power in the World Community
The German-speaking national block is a leader in job creation, technology, innovation and creativity in the global arena. An education in German helps students achieve their learning goals, whether they want to engage in business with German partners, work in government, in media or participate in German culture. Our students develop skills in reading, writing and oral communication while acquiring a rich understanding of the literature, cinema, history and culture of the German-speaking world.
